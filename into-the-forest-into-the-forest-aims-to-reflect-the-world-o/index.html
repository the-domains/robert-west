<p>Into the Forest “Into the Forest aims to reflect the World of both past and present, through grande and vibrance motifs of humans in forests around the World.” — ROBERT WEST  IN PROGRESS: Into the Forest. No.01. Oil on Canvas. 200 x 200 cm. 2014-Present  Overview  Into the Forest is West's first representational painting series. He begins to paint from a base photograph selecting and changing composition as the painting evolves, his primary concern is with the act of painting itself. The processes and techniques somehow seem to eventually lead to a more refined composition from where he began. West approaches representational painting the same way he does his abstract painting, fluid and unconstrained and sometimes seemingly destructive; that coupled with his technical proficiency is resulting in the creation of promising vivid alluring paintings.   Q & A Into the Forest  How have you found creating representational paintings rather than abstract ones ?  It has been a long slow process, but I believe ultimately it has been a successful one, it has broadened my approach to painting and will enable me to create more dynamic paintings in the future. My experience of both abstract and representational paintings places me in a unique position to build up a strong and expansive representational painting series.  Does your methodology in creating representational paintings differ from creating abstract paintings ?  The beginning of the painting process is different, I start with a photograph or film still that I have found on the Internet or elsewhere and use that as the base for a painting. There are not many rules to picking a photograph or film still other than there needs to be a person or people in a forest, and it needs to catch my attention if it does that is usually has the makings of a potentially great painting.  Have you found this base image for a painting useful or a hinderance ?  For the first time in my painting career I have an image to work from, to begin with I found it quite restrictive, but after a day of trying to replicate it in some way or another I began to approach the painting the same the way I create my abstract paintings concerning myself with the act of painting, working fluidly but now within the rough framework of the base photograph, refining and altering composition as I go.  The painting process allows you to be very inventive with regards representational painting if you choose to be; I believe many painters use the photograph more as a definite end point and this approach is restrictive, I look at the photograph more as a vague memory, something which can be interpreted more loosely so when I paint I will refer back to it perhaps once of twice a day, this approach allows for much more freedom in the painting process.  Do you believe that the techniques which you have learnt through creating a diverse range of abstract paintings are helping you to create more dynamic representational painting ?  Yes I do. I believe if you want to make paintings which are regarded highly, you need to know a great deal about how to paint in a variety of ways and not just how to paint a singular style repeated time and again; deepened my knowledge pool is something which has been my primary focus for the last seven years. I now possess a comprehensive understanding of the painting language which has been the result of long and difficult process of producing my experimental abstract paintings. I have always said the best representational painters where the greatest abstract painters and vice versa, but examples are few in number, those painters operated on a different level, not just in technical proficiency but in how they saw the World and indeed paintings roles within it. I think to produce work in this way and be respected for both my representational and abstract work is something which is a life long goal.   What are the plans for the Series ?  To create a painting series that is large in number and for the most part large in scale; the series aims to be bold, colourful, compositionally strong and fluid in its execution.   What are you most looking forward to ?  Getting some of the series finished so that they can be the benchmark for the paintings yet to be created; a lot of people have been interested in the development of the series; the initial few large scale paintings will be finished before December and I am beginning a few smaller works to see how various techniques translate on the smaller scale.  How important do you think being technically proficient is ?   Its paramount. Technical proficiency is something you teach yourself, because without the skill set you just have ideas, it is you who is solely accountable for what you can and cannot do with oil paints and a canvas. Technical ability is just one major part of the formula, having the base idea for the painting series is also critical in creating the reality and visual plain you were always searching for; Borderline and Into the Forest has ended that search for me, it has not been an easy process but I am confident that both series will provide the base for me to accomplish much within the field of Contemporary Painting.   Written October 2015  The Painting Process: Into the Forest 2014-Present</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="14"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="15"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="16"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="17"><span data-reactid="18"><!-- react-empty: 19 --><h2 data-reactid="20"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="21"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="22"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="24"></div></div></div></section></div></div>

I believe if you want to make paintings which are regarded highly, you need to know a great deal about how to paint in a variety of ways and not just how to paint a singular style repeated time and again; deepened my knowledge pool is something which has been my primary focus for the last seven years. I now possess a comprehensive understanding of the painting language which has been the result of long and difficult process of producing my experimental abstract paintings. I have always said the best representational painters where the greatest abstract painters and vice versa, but examples are few in number, those painters operated on a different level, not just in technical proficiency but in how they saw the World and indeed paintings roles within it. I think to produce work in this way and be respected for both my representational and abstract work is something which is a life long goal.   What are the plans for the Series ?  To create a painting series that is large in number and for the most part large in scale; the series aims to be bold, colourful, compositionally strong and fluid in its execution.   What are you most looking forward to ?  Getting some of the series finished so that they can be the benchmark for the paintings yet to be created; a lot of people have been interested in the development of the series; the initial few large scale paintings will be finished before December and I am beginning a few smaller works to see how various techniques translate on the smaller scale.  How important do you think being technically proficient is ?   Its paramount. Technical proficiency is something you teach yourself, because without the skill set you just have ideas, it is you who is solely accountable for what you can and cannot do with oil paints and a canvas. Technical ability is just one major part of the formula, having the base idea for the painting series is also critical in creating the reality and visual plain you were always searching for; Borderline and Into the Forest has ended that search for me, it has not been an easy process but I am confident that both series will provide the base for me to accomplish much within the field of Contemporary Painting.   Written October 2015  The Painting Process: Into the Forest
